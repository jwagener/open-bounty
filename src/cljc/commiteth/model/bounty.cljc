;; Most of the functions in here are currently intended for use inside the CLJS codebase
;; record maps look vastly different on frontend and backend due to simple things like kebab/camel
;; casing as well as more complex stuff like Postgres views shuffling data around

;; In the future we may want to establish Clojure records to assign names to the various
;; incarnations of maps we currently have adding the following functions to those records
;; via a protocol. Clojure records could also be serialized via transit making it easier
;; to communicate what datatypes are returned where.
